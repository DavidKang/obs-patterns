title: Preformatted text
category: molecules
description: Some elements like the code editor or the log output for Rpmlint show preformatted text. Those elements contain a pre HTML tag, and
  Bootstrap sets a monospace font stack for them. However,  we decided to fix their size to 0.95rem to prevent they look bigger than the rest on the
  texts.

%h5 Log output

:css
  pre { font-size: .95rem }

%pre
  :preserve
    This is    the log output
      with a          preformatted
            text.
