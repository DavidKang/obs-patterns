description: After some research, we decided to stick with the [Native font stack](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/reboot/#native-font-stack) as we want to rely on system fonts.
             We use the [default fonts from Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/reboot/#native-font-stack) with the default font-size of `16px`.
             We use Bootstrap [typography](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/typography/) and [text](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/text/) classes when needed.
             We also use the monospace font stack provided by Bootstrap for preformatted text (pre HTML tag) or elements with class .text-monospace.
